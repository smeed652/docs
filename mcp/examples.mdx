## Daily Operations

### Morning System Check

Ask Claude to provide a morning briefing:

```
"Give me a morning briefing on the pipeline system.
Include any overnight alerts, rectifiers needing attention,
and upcoming compliance deadlines."
```

Claude will use `get_pipeline_summary`, `search_assets`, and compliance tools to generate a comprehensive report.

### Finding Problem Areas

```
"Find all test stations that have had readings below -850mV
in the last 7 days and show me which rectifiers protect them."
```

This combines `query_measurements`, `search_assets`, and `find_protection_systems`.

## Risk Analysis

### Impact Assessment

```
"If rectifier R-2145 goes offline, what segments would be affected
and what's the current risk level of each?"
```

```
"Analyze the potential impact of a power outage at the
Northern substation on our CP systems."
```

### Trend Analysis

```
"Show me the pipe-to-soil potential trends for segment S-1001
over the last 90 days. Are there any concerning patterns?"
```

## Compliance

### Compliance Status Check

```
"What's our current compliance status for 49 CFR 192.465?
Are there any test stations overdue for readings?"
```

### Audit Preparation

```
"Generate a summary of all CP activities for Q4 2024
that I can use for the upcoming PHMSA audit."
```

## Reporting

### Executive Summary

```
"Create an executive summary of our pipeline integrity program
for the board meeting. Include key metrics, recent improvements,
and any areas of concern."
```

### Technician Briefing

```
"What work should be prioritized for the field team today?
Focus on safety-critical items and upcoming compliance deadlines."
```

## Advanced Workflows

### Multi-Step Analysis

Here's an example of a complex analysis workflow:

1. **Identify the scope**: "Show me all pipelines in the Eastern region"
2. **Find issues**: "Which of these have had below-threshold readings?"
3. **Analyze impact**: "For the affected segments, what's the business impact if corrosion accelerates?"
4. **Recommend action**: "Based on this analysis, what should be our remediation priority?"

### Integration with Other Tools

Combine CorrData data with other MCP servers:

```
"Use the CorrData data to identify high-risk segments,
then use the calendar tool to schedule inspections
and the email tool to notify the field team."
```

## Sample Conversations

<Accordion title="Rectifier Troubleshooting">
**User**: "Rectifier R-3001 is showing reduced output. What's going on?"

**Claude**: Let me investigate R-3001...
- Current output: 2.3A (normal range: 4-6A)
- Last maintenance: 45 days ago
- Connected test stations: 4 (TS-401, TS-402, TS-403, TS-404)
- Recent P/S readings at connected stations are trending toward -750mV

**Recommendation**: This appears to be a rectifier issue, not a demand increase. Suggest dispatching a technician to check:
1. AC input voltage
2. Rectifier tap settings
3. Cable connections

Would you like me to generate a work order?

<Accordion title="Compliance Deadline Alert">
**User**: "What compliance deadlines do we have coming up?"

**Claude**: I found the following upcoming deadlines:

| Deadline | Requirement | Items Due | Status |
|----------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| Dec 15, 2024 | 49 CFR 192.465 | 12 test stations | 8 complete, 4 pending |
| Dec 31, 2024 | Annual rectifier inspection | 3 rectifiers | Not started |
| Jan 15, 2025 | 49 CFR 192.463 | Interference survey | Scheduled |

**Priority Actions**:
1. Complete the 4 pending test station reads this week
2. Schedule rectifier inspections before holiday shutdown

Would you like me to create tasks for these items?
