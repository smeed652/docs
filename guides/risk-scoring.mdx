description: "Understanding CorrData's multi-factor risk assessment system"

## Overview

CorrData calculates risk scores using a multi-factor model that considers:

- Cathodic protection effectiveness
- Coating condition
- Environmental factors
- Operational parameters
- Historical performance

## Risk Score Scale

| Score | Level | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 0-25 | Low | Well-protected, no immediate concerns |
| 26-50 | Medium | Monitor closely, schedule routine maintenance |
| 51-75 | High | Requires attention, prioritize inspection |
| 76-100 | Critical | Immediate action required |

## Risk Factors

### Cathodic Protection (40%)

- Pipe-to-soil potential measurements
- Rectifier output adequacy
- Anode bed condition
- Current distribution

### Coating Condition (25%)

- Coating type and age
- Holiday detection results
- Disbondment surveys
- Repair history

### Environmental (20%)

- Soil resistivity
- Soil pH and moisture
- Proximity to interference sources
- Flooding potential

### Operational (15%)

- Product type
- Operating pressure
- Age of pipeline
- Consequence of failure

## Risk Trending

CorrData tracks risk scores over time to identify:

- Improving or degrading conditions
- Seasonal patterns
- Impact of remediation activities
- Long-term trends

## Risk-Based Prioritization

Use risk scores to prioritize:

1. **Inspections** - Focus on high-risk segments first
2. **Maintenance** - Allocate resources where needed most
3. **Capital Projects** - Justify replacement decisions
4. **Compliance** - Demonstrate due diligence

## Customization

Operators can customize:

- Factor weights based on their system
- Threshold values for risk levels
- Inclusion/exclusion of specific factors
- Alert triggers

<Warning>
  Risk scores are decision-support tools, not definitive safety assessments. Always apply engineering judgment.
